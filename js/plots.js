Determine the origin point of the spell randomly. Everyone within a 10 ft. by 10 ft. area originating on that space is teleported 50 ft. upward in a constant loop for 1d4 turns. On their turn, they may make a Strength saving throw and if they succeed move to the nearest space outside the affected zone, but takes falling damage based on the height they were at the time of their escape, determined at random: 1d10 roll 1-2 50 ft. 5d6 bludgeoning damage. 3-4 40 ft. 4d6 bludgeoning damage. 5-6 30 ft. 3d6 bludgeoning damage. 7-8 20 ft. 2d6 bludgeoning damage. 9-10 10 ft. 1d6 bludgeoning damage.
